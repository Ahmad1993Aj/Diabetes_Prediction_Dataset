# Diabetes_Prediction_Dataset
This repository contains a dataset and code for diabetes prediction. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is intended for use in developing machine learning models to predict the presence or absence of diabetes based on various input features. The code provided includes data analysis using popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, followed by the implementation of the Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression algorithms to calculate accuracy.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be accessed from the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset. It contains information related to diabetes diagnosis, including several input features such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others. The dataset also provides the corresponding target variable, indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not.

# Code Files:
The code files included in this repository are designed to analyze the diabetes prediction dataset and build machine learning models using two different algorithms: Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. The steps involved are as follows:

1-  Data Analysis: The dataset is loaded using pandas, and various exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain insights into the data. This may include examining data distributions, identifying missing values, visualizing relationships between variables, and more.

2-  Data Preprocessing: In this step, the dataset is prepared for training the machine learning models. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3-  Model Training: The Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression models are trained on the prepared training data using the scikit-learn library. These models learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable.

4-  Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using the testing data to measure their accuracy in predicting diabetes outcomes. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score may be computed to assess the models' effectiveness.
